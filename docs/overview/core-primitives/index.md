# Core Primitives

These pages cover the low-level mechanisms that make Atomiq's trustless swap protocol possible. They define how Bitcoin state is verified on-chain, how funds are escrowed across chains, and how settlement can be enforced without relying on a trusted intermediary.

This section introduces these foundational primitives before moving into higher-level swap flows and contract architecture
